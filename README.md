* **[Feature 4]:** [e.g., "Intuitive command-line interface"]

## üöÄ Getting Started

Jump right into the action.

### Installation

**Download the latest release:**
[Link to your GitHub Releases page where CyberWarrior.exe is]

**Or build from source (if applicable):**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/GouravOngit/CyberWarrior.git](https://github.com/GouravOngit/CyberWarrior.git)
cd CyberWarrior
Complete pre-install checklist (what must be done on any target machine before installing/running CyberWarrior.exe)

Host OS and architecture

Windows 10 or Windows 11 (64-bit) recommended.
The built exe is a Windows binary. Test on the same major Windows version you‚Äôll deploy to.
Administrative privileges

Running the program (or packet-capture features) requires Administrator privileges. Always run the exe with ‚ÄúRun as administrator‚Äù.
Packet-capture driver: Npcap

Scapy (used by the app) requires a packet capture driver on Windows. Install Npcap (the maintained replacement for WinPcap).
Download: https://nmap.org/npcap/
Install options:
Enable ‚ÄúSupport raw 802.11 traffic (and monitor mode) for wireless adapters‚Äù only if needed.
Select ‚ÄúInstall Npcap in WinPcap API-compatible Mode‚Äù if other legacy apps need it.
Reboot may be required after installing.
Visual C++ Redistributable

For safety, install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015‚Äì2022 Redistributable (x64). This reduces the chance of missing runtime DLLs on target machines.
Download from Microsoft (search ‚ÄúMicrosoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015-2022‚Äù or use: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)
Antivirus / SmartScreen considerations

Unsigned executables can trigger Windows SmartScreen or AV alerts. Options:
Code-sign the executable with a trusted certificate (recommended for distribution).
Provide internal users instructions to bypass SmartScreen temporarily (not recommended for general distribution).
Add the exe to corporate AV whitelist if distributing inside an organization.
Safety / legal / ethical considerations

Packet capture and blocking features can intercept or disrupt network traffic. Only install and run on networks where you have permission.
Test first on an isolated VM or lab network to avoid disrupting production traffic.
Hardware and resources (minimal)

2 GB RAM minimum; 4 GB recommended for comfortable GUI use.
Disk: a few hundred MB free (the exe is single-file but unpacking may use extra space).
Files in the repo you should distribute / verify

CyberWarrior.exe (final built executable ‚Äî created when the build completes)
src\assets\cyber_bg.png (optional background image if you distribute assets separately)
README.md (you should add one; I listed it in todos)
requirements.txt (runtime) ‚Äî created
build-requirements.txt (build-time) ‚Äî created
How to prepare a target machine (commands for a Windows admin, PowerShell)

Install Npcap (interactive GUI installer) from the link above.
Install Visual C++ Redistributable using the installer from Microsoft.
If you want to run from source instead of exe (developer machine)

Activate the repo virtual environment:
Install runtime requirements:
To build the exe (on your build machine only, with build tools installed):
The script runs PyInstaller and writes CyberWarrior.exe if successful.
Quick checks to perform after building (test checklist)

Run CyberWarrior.exe as Administrator.
Log in using username Gourav and password Gourav@123.
Start capture and verify packets appear in the GUI (on a network with traffic).
Verify the AI suggestion box populates when simulated attacks appear (the app uses simulated detection logic).
Confirm auto-blocked IPs appear in the blocked IPs list.
Recommended extras before broad distribution

Code-sign the executable (reduces SmartScreen/AV flags).
Create a signed installer (MSI) that sets required Windows features and optionally installs Npcap.
Add a README.md with usage, testing steps, and disclaimers (I added this to the todo list).
Keep a backup of the dist build and compute a SHA256 checksum for reproducible distribution:
Example (PowerShell):
Files I added for you

requirements.txt (runtime dependencies)
build-requirements.txt (build-time dependencies)
Updated todo list inside repo metadata (managed via the repo tasks I created)
Next steps I can take for you (pick any)
